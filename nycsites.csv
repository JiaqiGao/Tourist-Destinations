Long Island,Suffolk County,Smithtown Township Arts Council,"Smithtown Township Arts Council (STAC) is a nonprofit 501 (c) (3) community cultural organization that exists to integrate the arts into the fabric of everyday life in Smithtown Township.  The noted New York City architect, Calvin Pollard, designed the Greek Revival Mills Pond house in 1838 for William Wickham Mills. Like his client, Pollard was born in 1797 and was raised in upstate New York, but found success in the big city. Mills descended from a long line of wealthy Long Island farmers whogave the name Mills Pond to an area known to the Indians as Cuttscunsuck (two small ponds""). Mills Pond House preserves the locality's name but departs from tradition in other respects. Its high-style Grecian design is unusual on Long Island and the hand of an accomplished architect is nearly unique at this early date. Pollard's influence is seen in the use of imported materials: Albany boards Carolina yellow pine English glass Connecticut stone and Santo Domingan mahogany. Even the silvered hardware decorative plaster and carpeting were bought in New York City shops. William Wickham Mills died in 1865 and his home descended in the family until its gift to the Town of Smithtown in 1976. Since that time it has been home to the Smithtown Township Arts Council who uses the magnificent facility to promote the arts to protect and enrich its township’s unique quality of life.""",40.896473899999997,-73.149275200000005,Arts & Culture,Art & Culture Museums|Galleries & Art spaces|Other Performing Arts,http://www.stacarts.org,,"(40.896473899999997, -73.149275200000005)"
